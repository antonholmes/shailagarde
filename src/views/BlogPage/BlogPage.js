                                Civil wedding. New York City. June 29, 2018.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                Anton proposed on January 29 in Manila, a few days before we left for the US. We planned to visit loved ones in a couple of states, plus he wanted to take some short courses in software engineering. One random day (June 21), a few friends broached the idea of getting married at City Hall and we thought, hey, why not?
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                We got our marriage license on the 26th and set the date for the 29th, same as the proposal. We put together our outfits the night before: Anton’s suit was brought from Manila, along with the clip-on bowtie (₩1,000) bought in Seoul. I cut his hair. His leather boots were hand-me-downs from our hosts Arya and Lester. The only thing we bought for him was the dress shirt ($18) from a bargain department store called Century 21. My Silvian Heach lace dress ($70) and bag ($20) were also from Century 21.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                My shoes ($34.95) are PRADA—we were told they were worth $1,800. I got them from Beacon’s Closet, a chain of ukay-ukay (thrift stores). I wanted my dress to come from there, too, but none fit me quite right. (I had to handstitch the neckline and pin the back straps of the dress I ended up getting, too.) Accessories were brought from Manila, except for the hat, which our friend Beanne got from Amazon as a gift.
                              </p>

                                We became fast friends with a Filipino couple from New Jersey, Mark and Beanne. As soon as we decided to get married, we knew they would be the ones we ask to be our witnesses. Anton and I both have relatives spread out in the US, but we wouldn’t have the time (or money) to organize everything in such a way that’s fair to both parties, so we decided it was just gonna be the four of us. We asked them over a Korean barbecue dinner (one of many). Beanne promptly ordered the hat soon after.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                The morning of the wedding, we took the cab from Queens to City Hall and lined up. It was first-come, first-serve, so I did my makeup while in line. Mark and Beanne drove there early and happily helped us with whatever we needed: carrying our bags, documentation, cheering us on. They even got me a rental bouquet ($5) to take photos with!
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                We didn’t get rings, and we didn’t ask for anyone special to officiate. Our thinking was that this would be a quick and fuss-free wedding, with a “real” one later on surrounded with our family and friends and done in a more traditional way.

                                We were famished and parched after taking photos on the Brooklyn Bridge. It was a sweltering summer day! These two treated us to brunch at a place called Clinton Hall, near South Street Seaport in Manhattan’s financial district. Our “wedding cake” was called WTF Waffle (red velvet with lots of things on it). We had burgers, fries, sangria, and kamote fries with marshmallow dip. We also played Connect Four. Too bad we had to cut it short, as Anton had to go to a class in the afternoon.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                A lot of unexpected things happened to us in the US. They run the gamut from awesome or funny or good to bad or ugly or traumatic. This wedding is in its own category: perfect. We wouldn’t have had it any other way.

                                On the day itself, we took the cab from Queens to City Hall and lined up. It was first-come, first serve, so Shai did her makeup in line while in pambahay and tsinelas, then dressed later on when we had secured a slot.

                                Photos were taken on the Brooklyn Bridge. It was a sweltering summer day!  Reception was at a bistro called Clinton Hall, near South Street Seaport FIDI. Our cake was called WTF Waffle (red velvet with a lot of things on it) and we had burgers, winter sangria, and kamote fries with marshmallow dip. So good. We played Connect-4.
                              <br />
                              Anton had to go to class in the afternoon, so we all parted ways after lunch.

                              Church wedding is planned for December 29, 2019 (January proposal, June civil wedding, December church wedding, all 29. We’d book-end the year with anniversaries!)
